Building locally:

1. Install hugo extended (ctrl-f "extended") from https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases
2. Install SCSS (https://sass-lang.com/install -- your favorite package manager is generally enough)
3. `hugo serve`

Deployment is automatically handled by GitHub Actions. Pushing is enough for it to go live.
