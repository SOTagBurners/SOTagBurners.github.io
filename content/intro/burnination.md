# A crash-course in burnination

{{<section "How does the burnination process work?" "about">}}

### Initiating

A tag can be burned on the spot by yourself if **all** holds true:

1. You have at least a **bronze** badge in the tag or one of the related tags.
2. You conferred with **at least one** other [trusted user](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/trusted-user).
3. There are **less than 50** questions with the tag.

Otherwise, you **must** follow the burnination process.

### Stage 1: Proposal

First, make sure the tag **fails** all of the criteria for burnination:

1. Does it **describe the contents** of the questions to which it is applied? and is it **unambiguous**?
2. Is the concept described even **on-topic** for the site?
3. Does the tag add any **meaningful information** to the post?
4. Does it mean **the same thing** in all common contexts?

If it passes at least **one**, do not proceed and consider other options, if it is:

ambiguous, create a {{< tag "meta.stackoverflow.com" "tag-disambiguation" >}} request.

poorly named, make a {{< tag "meta.stackoverflow.com" "retag-request" >}} request.

too similar to another tag, write up a {{< tag "meta.stackoverflow.com" "synonym-request" >}} request.

----

If **all fail**, create a {{< external "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/ask" "meta" "Meta Stack Overflow" >}} post tagged {{< tag "meta.stackoverflow.com" "burninate-request" >}} with arguments for **each** of the burnination criteria.

Here is a helpful template to get you started:

```md
I believe the tag [tag:tagname] should be burninated.

It fails all the preliminary checks before burnination:

> Does it describe the contents of the questions to which it is applied? and is it unambiguous?

**No**, !-- reasons why it is ambiguous or is a "meta" tag -->

> Is the concept described even on-topic for the site?

**No**, <!-- TODO: reasons why it is used on off-topic posts -->

> Does the tag add any meaningful information to the post?

**No**, <!-- TODO: reasons why it adds no meaningful information -->

> Does it mean the same thing in all common contexts?

**No**, <!-- TODO: reasons why it means different things -->

It is also problematic because:

<!-- TODO: custom requester reasons -->
```
