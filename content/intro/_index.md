{{< section "A crash course to tag moderation" "intro" true >}}

Tag moderation primarily consists of three components: synonyms, disambiguation, and burnination. The latter two tend to be more visible, with burnination being the only part with a currently established process heavily involving the community.

Tag moderation is often necessary for a number of reasons, including consolidating topics, clarifying tags, and cleaning up off-topic tags. Some times, burninations also give us an opportunity to clean up large amounts of off-topic questions, whether new or old.

## How do I participate?

There's several ways to participate, even if you don't have much time to put into it.

### Burnination

If you're interested in participating in a burnination, [see this document](burnination.html).

### Disambiguating

Some tags are ambiguous (usually due to poor naming), causing unrelated questions to be grouped.

If you think a tag needs to be disambiguated, please make a {{< external "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/ask" "meta" "Meta Stack Overflow" >}} post with the {{< tag "meta.stackoverflow.com" "tag-disambiguation" >}} tag.

### Retagging

If you found a set of questions tagged incorrectly or think a tag has to be merged with another, please make a {{< external "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/ask" "meta" "Meta Stack Overflow" >}} post tagged {{< tag "meta.stackoverflow.com" "retag-request" >}}.

### Synonymizing

As for synonyms, there's not always a lot to do here. If you stumble into nearly identical tags, you can post a question on {{< external "https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/ask" "meta" "Meta Stack Overflow" >}} with the {{< tag "meta.stackoverflow.com" "synonym-request" >}} tag.
